# Description

One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.

In this competition, historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions is provided. Each store contains many departments, and the goal is to project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday events are included in the dataset. These holidays are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

# Evaluation

This competition is evaluated on the weighted mean absolute error (WMAE)
